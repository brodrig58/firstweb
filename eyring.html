      <h4>Biography</h4>
      <p>Henry Eyring (1901–1981) was an influential American chemist who made groundbreaking contributions to our understanding of chemical reactions. He’s best known for creating the Eyring equation, which helped explain how molecules interact during chemical processes. His work, particularly in the field of chemical kinetics, changed the way scientists think about reaction mechanisms. Throughout his career, Eyring held key academic positions, most notably at the University of Utah, and was respected not only for his research but also for his role in shaping the next generation of scientists. His legacy lives on in both the theories he developed and the impact he had on the scientific community.

    <h4>Notable Contributions:<h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Helped create a theory that explains how chemical reactions happen by passing through a high-energy state before turning into products.</li>
        <li>Developed an equation that connects the speed of chemical reactions to temperature and energy.</li>
        <li>Used quantum mechanics to explain how molecules behave during reactions, combining classical chemistry with new science.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Famous Quote:</h4>
      <blockquote>"The important thing is not to stop questioning, Curiosity has its own reason for existing."</blockquote>
